Notes:  
To summarize, cryptocurrency has the potential to be the cornerstone of a better monetary system that allows individuals greater control over their possessions, and it appears that it is becoming more widely accepted as time goes on, but their volatile market value caused the cryptoassets to be perceived as a big bubble that's gonna pop and destroy everyone's financial resources.  

Even though the crypto market can be viewed as a gigantic bubble, it would be no different from the .com bubble in early 2000s, that caused the stocks to crash for all the internet-related companies born in those years.  

What we learned from that bubble is that even though the excessive speculative nature of the movement imploded rapidly, the tecnology was there to stay.  

Same for cryptocurrencies: the technology is here to stay and it's the cornerstone for a new type of internet, called web 3.0.
