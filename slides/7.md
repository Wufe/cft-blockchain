Notes:

Something else to say about the Bitcoin protocol:  
- Every block has a **coinbase transaction** that indicates where to send the mining reward  
- The difficulty of mining (that is the zero bits prefix on the hash) is calculated based on the **entire network mining power**  
- The mining reward gets **halved** roughly **every 4 years**, so we say that the cryptocurrency is deflationary
- The transactions in Bitcoin consists of a set of instructions of a basic **scripting language**
