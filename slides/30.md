                Cryptokitties is a game that allows you to raise kittens that are technically NFTs and can be traded on corresponding marketplaces.  <br />
These cats have some form of stats and related rarity, which increases their worth.  <br />
You may raise your cat NFT and sell it for money, or you can rent your cat for breeding as a way to earn money passively.
