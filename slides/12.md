Notes:
The truth is that since the blockchain uses cryptocurrencies to function, the cryptocurrencies have gained their intrinsic value, and formed a new type of economy based on the speculation of the value of these **digital assets**.  

Lots of cryptocurrency brokers or **exchanges** are born since the raise of Bitcoin, some examples are:
- Binance
- Coinbase
- Crypto.com

Some of them even launched their own cryptocurrencies.

Coinbase has even gone public getting listed on Nasdaq in April 2021.
