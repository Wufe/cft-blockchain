Notes:
Let's move over to the last part of the presentation.

One of the most concerning issue about Bitcoin and all Proof-of-work based blockchains is their impact on global environment.  

Proof-of-work is similar to bruteforcing a password because it is based on attempting to guess a nonce that would fulfill a hash requirement.

Miners use GPUs to generate millions of hashes per second of processing power.
To increase mining performance, a miner setup could be built with more than one GPU.  

As more people entered the mining community, more specialized organizations and hardware were developed to increase their chances of finding the correct hash of a block and being rewarded.
It makes sense for you, the miner, to gather together all of this hardware to generate hashes 24 hours a day, seven days a week in massive server farms.
Even if the electric bill is high, the earnings are higher due to the cryptocurrency's rising price.

Bitcoin is claimed to require approximately 127 terawatt-hours of electricity per year, which is comparable to Argentina's energy consumption.

Because it is designed similarly to digital gold, it makes more sense to compare its energy usage to that of gold mining, which is reported to require roughly 240 terawatt-hours per year.

Despite the fact that many mining farms in China utilize fossil-fuel-derived electricity, many other farms use renewable energy, and the mining business is actually encouraging innovation in the green energy sector because miners migrate to where the power is cheaper.  

However, I believe that all of these comparisons, pros and cons, are irrelevant since the technology itself may be improved to achieve its goals without consuming such a large amount of energy.  

For these reason A LOT of new consensus protocol have been invented.

Bitcoin, Ethereum, Dogecoin, and Litecoin are the most influential coins that still use proof of work.
However, Ethereum will transition to the proof-of-stake consensus protocol next year.

Proof of stake, by the way, is a consensus mechanism that eliminates the need to generate a hash starting with a fixed number of 0 bits for the block.
With this technique, cryptocurrency owners can stake their currencies, granting them the ability to validate new blocks and transactions.
Misbehavior is discouraged by slashing the stake whenever a validation appears to be fraudulent.  

Many blockchains are now rejecting proof of work as a consensus mechanism due to its environmental impact, and some blockchains like Algorand are even carbon-negative. That is, they aim for very low power usage while also investing in giving back funds to environmental initiatives.
