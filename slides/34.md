                Proof of stake, by the way, is a consensus mechanism that eliminates the need to generate a hash starting with a fixed number of 0 bits for the block.<br />
With this technique, cryptocurrency owners can stake their currencies, granting them the ability to validate new blocks and transactions.<br />
Misbehavior is discouraged by slashing the stake whenever a validation appears to be fraudulent.

        Many blockchains are now rejecting proof of work as a consensus mechanism due to its environmental impact, and some blockchains like Algorand are even carbon-negative. That is, they aim for very low power usage while also investing in giving back funds to environmental initiatives.
