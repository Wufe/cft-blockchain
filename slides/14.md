Notes:

As of today, cryptocurrency trading has not been included in traditional financial sectors like ETFs directly, only as a byproduct of them:  
the first Bitcoin ETF has been announced and approved by the SEC in October 2021, and it does not literally owns Bitcoins, but it holds Bitcoin futures based on another exchange.  

This totally exposes the fluctuation of the price of this ETF to the strategical decision of the managers of the fund.  

Apparently we will not see a spot Bitcoin ETF soon in the stable stock exchange market.
