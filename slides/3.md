### Disclaimer: I'm <strong>not an expert</strong> on blockchain tech<br />
(and I won't become one soon)

Notes:
Just a little disclaimer:
I currently am not an expert on blockchain technology,  
and I won't become one soon.

Every piece of tech, every algorithm, every single structure  
has been through lots of rethinking and innovation,
and every single piece was already or became an entire field of study.

I always wanted to study the technology and I took this opportunity to learn something about it,  
so my fear of missing out will not grow stronger.
