Notes:
But the revolution is in progress:  
lots of influential people started investing in cryptocurrencies and started moving a huge amount of assets on cryptocurrencies.  

One of them is Michael Saylor, that in July 2020 decided for his company MicroStrategy to buy and hold Bitcoin instead of holding cash, due to the upcoming hard inflation that would have caused the value of the stored cash to drop substantially.  

Many people -infact- use cryptocurrency as a sort of protection against the roaring inflation due to the maneuvers of the Central Bank.

The result is that his company, MicroStrategy has become a kind of Bitcoin proxy investment for some investors, and the company stocks gained traction fast going from 120 dollars to 720 dollars in a year and half.
