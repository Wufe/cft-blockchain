#### A distributed and decentralized overview

Notes:
In this talk we are going to explore the blockchain technology by giving an overview.  

Probably most of you already know a lot about this technology, but I think it is going to be crucial for everyone of us who work in the technology industry, so we all may need to be on the same page.  

Even though the whole cryptocurrencies market is seen as a giant bubble that is going to explode in the near future, will it explode or not, the technology is here to stay.  

It can only evolve.
