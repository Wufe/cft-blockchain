Notes:
Some companies started supplying Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) creating new blockchains or new tokens on the ethereum blockchain.  
ICOs are a mechanism for a business to raise funds for a new concept through crowdsourcing by handing back tokens to investors.  
These tokens are similar to corporation shares in that they allow investors to participate in surveys and decision making.  
They are comparable to initial public offerings (IPOs), except they are based on a cryptocurrency or token.  

All these tokens usually were ERC-20 tokens on the Ethereum network.
