Notes:
A person of interest in the crypto-space is Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla, SpaceX and some other big companies, that has become known for his social market manipulations, being a real-world Tony Stark with a lot of influence among the crowd.  

He usually shares thoughts and comments on Twitter, indirectly implying assets movements toward a specific asset, that result in the price increase of the same.  

In the beginning of 2021 Musk said that Tesla invested 1.5 billions in Bitcoin and they would start to accept Bitcoin as a form of payment.  
This resulted in a huge price spike in BTC price.  
A few months later he changed his mind saying that they were concerned about the impact on the rapid increasing of the use of fossil fuels for Bitcoin mining and transactions and that Tesla would not accept Bitcoin anymore.  
Of course the price of Bitcoin dropped.  

He instead asked if anyone would have liked to have a previously existing meme-cryptocurrency called Dogecoin as a payment for Tesla, and that resulted too in an increase of the price of Dogecoin, which was a cryptocurrency created as a joke from two software engineers, Billy Markus and Jackson Palmer.
