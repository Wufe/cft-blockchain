Notes:
As you can see the crypto currency market evaluation is subject to a lot of fluctuation due to this hype-culture which tends to keep the standard investors away from it, due to its volatile and totally speculative nature.  

The mindset that drives the inverstors is that this new economic wave can be surfed while it is growing, with enough care, trying not to drawn beaneath it.  

For analysing the market price, the already existing rules of the technical analysis work pretty well, even though the fundamental analysis could not be performed, since there's no real-world value behind a cryptocurrency, but the value is totally based on the ratio between supply and demand.  

The new instruments for gaining some insights of the prices of the cryptocurrencies and outrun the market, are the socials, the influential words of a small amount of people and the trends of the mass driven by hype, but also it seems that the transition to a broader view of the economic system is inevitable, and the most influential cryptoassets are going to increase in value over time.
