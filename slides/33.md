                        One of the most concerning issue about Bitcoin and all Proof-of-work based blockchains is their impact on global environment.

                        Proof-of-work is similar to bruteforcing a password because it is based on attempting to guess a nonce that would fulfill a hash requirement.

                        Miners use GPUs to generate millions of hashes per second.<br />
To increase mining performance, a miner setup could be built with more than one GPU.

                        As more people entered the mining community, more specialized organizations and hardware were developed to increase their chances of finding the correct hash of a block and being rewarded.<br /><br />
It makes sense for you, the miner, to gather together all of this hardware to generate hashes 24 hours a day, seven days a week in massive server farms.<br /><br />
Even if the electric bill is high, the earnings are higher due to the cryptocurrency's rising price.

                <aside class="notes">
                    Because it is designed similarly to digital gold, it makes more sense to compare its energy usage to that of gold mining, which is reported to require roughly 240 terawatt-hours per year.

                Despite the fact that many mining farms in China utilize fossil-fuel-derived electricity, many other farms use renewable energy, and the mining business is actually encouraging innovation in the green energy sector because miners migrate to where the power is cheaper.  <br /><br />

    <h3>The environmental impact</h3>
    <h3>is a <strong>fact</strong></h3>
    <aside class="notes">
        However, I believe that all of these comparisons, pros and cons, are irrelevant since the technology itself may be improved to achieve its goals without consuming such a large amount of energy.
