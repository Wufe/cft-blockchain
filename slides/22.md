        Ethereum is the most well-known open-source Bitcoin successor.  <br />
It was developed by Vitalik Buterin in 2013 and its main client is written in Go.<br />
<br />
The key characteristic of Ethereum is that it enables the execution of decentralized applications (DApps) by implementing an EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) capable of running smart contracts, which are essentially software programs written for the blockchain.

        Ethereum smart contracts, like bitcoin transactions, are immutable and deterministic, which means they can be checked by each miner and produce the same outcome every time.

    <aside class="notes">
        The Ethereum network is designed to be quicker than Bitcoin, with an average block time of 12 to 14 seconds compared to Bitcoin's block time of 10 minutes.  <br />
<br />
This fast network enabled the growth of a diverse range of financial services that fall under the category of DeFi (Decentralized Finance), allowing for the supply of common financial services without the need of financial intermediaries.

    <aside class="notes">
    Ether is the main currency in Ethereum and it is used to pay for transactions in ethereum.  <br /><br />
There are main common denominations for Ether.<br /><br />
1 ETH corresponds to:<br />
- 1 Quintillion WEI (1.000.000.000.000.000.000)<br />
- 1 Quadrillion KWEI (1.000.000.000.000.000)<br />
- 1 Trillion MWEI (1.000.000.000.000)<br />
- 1 Billion GWEI<br />
- 1 Million TWEI<br /><br />

        When talking about ethereum we can encounter the term Ethereum Classic ( ETC ), that is the original Ethereum blockchain before the DAO Hack, a famous hacking maneuver that made the Ethereum network to split via an hard fork agreed from the community, but not everyone.  <br />
<br />
DAO stands for Decentralized Autonomous Organization, and it was a large-scale fundraising organization, however their smart contracts included a weakness that allowed certain hackers to take cash without approval.  <br />
<br />
A hard fork occurs when there is a breaking change in the blockchain software and the network of clients can no longer agree on the same protocol, resulting in the formation of a new blockchain.

        The ethereum blockchain has a broad enterprise support and in 2017 the enterprise ethereum alliance was created, including many organizations like:<br />
- Accenture<br />
- FedEx Corporate Services, Inc<br />
- JP Morgan Chase Bank<br />
- Microsoft<br />
- Sberbank of Russia<br />
- VMware<br />
- Web3 Labs<br />
and many more..<br />
<br />
Their goal is to build and support the ethereum blockchain.  <br />
Their mission statement states as follows: "We will learn from and build upon the only smart contract supporting blockchain currently running in real-world production – Ethereum – to define enterprise-grade software capable of handling the most complex, highly demanding applications at the speed of business."<br />

    <aside class="notes">
        The entire ecosystem of DApps is thus based on the concept of smart contracts, which are software written in a prioprietary language called Solidity.  <br /><br />
With a smart contract you can:<br />
- perform data logic<br />
- read or execute other contracts<br />
- send or withdraw ether<br /><br />
But the execution of the smart contracts is limited by the available amount of Gas.
