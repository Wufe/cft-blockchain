        Ethereum is the most well-known open-source Bitcoin successor.  <br />
It was developed by Vitalik Buterin in 2013 and its main client is written in Go.<br />
<br />
The key characteristic of Ethereum is that it enables the execution of decentralized applications (DApps) by implementing an EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) capable of running smart contracts, which are essentially software programs written for the blockchain.

        Ethereum smart contracts, like bitcoin transactions, are immutable and deterministic, which means they can be checked by each miner and produce the same outcome every time.

            Ethereum is faster than Bitcoin
            <br /><br />
            Hosts decentralized financial services (DeFi)

    <aside class="notes">
        The Ethereum network is designed to be quicker than Bitcoin, with an average block time of 12 to 14 seconds compared to Bitcoin's block time of 10 minutes.  <br />
<br />
This fast network enabled the growth of a diverse range of financial services that fall under the category of DeFi (Decentralized Finance), allowing for the supply of common financial services without the need of financial intermediaries.
