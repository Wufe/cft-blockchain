        Ethereum is the most well-known open-source Bitcoin successor.  <br />
It was developed by Vitalik Buterin in 2013 and its main client is written in Go.<br />
<br />
The key characteristic of Ethereum is that it enables the execution of decentralized applications (DApps) by implementing an EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) capable of running smart contracts, which are essentially software programs written for the blockchain.

    <aside class="notes">
        The Ethereum network is designed to be quicker than Bitcoin, with an average block time of 12 to 14 seconds compared to Bitcoin's block time of 10 minutes.  <br />
<br />
This fast network enabled the growth of a diverse range of financial services that fall under the category of DeFi (Decentralized Finance), allowing for the supply of common financial services without the need of financial intermediaries.

        When talking about ethereum we can encounter the term Ethereum Classic ( ETC ), that is the original Ethereum blockchain before the DAO Hack, a famous hacking maneuver that made the Ethereum network to split via an hard fork agreed from the community, but not everyone.  <br />
<br />
DAO stands for Decentralized Autonomous Organization, and it was a large-scale fundraising organization, however their smart contracts included a weakness that allowed certain hackers to take cash without approval.  <br />
<br />
A hard fork occurs when there is a breaking change in the blockchain software and the network of clients can no longer agree on the same protocol, resulting in the formation of a new blockchain.

        The ethereum blockchain has a broad enterprise support and in 2017 the enterprise ethereum alliance was created, including many organizations like:<br />
- Accenture<br />
- FedEx Corporate Services, Inc<br />
- JP Morgan Chase Bank<br />
- Microsoft<br />
- Sberbank of Russia<br />
- VMware<br />
- Web3 Labs<br />
and many more..<br />
<br />
Their goal is to build and support the ethereum blockchain.  <br />
Their mission statement states as follows: "We will learn from and build upon the only smart contract supporting blockchain currently running in real-world production – Ethereum – to define enterprise-grade software capable of handling the most complex, highly demanding applications at the speed of business."<br />

    <aside class="notes">
        The entire ecosystem of DApps is thus based on the concept of smart contracts, which are software written in a prioprietary language called Solidity.  <br /><br />
With a smart contract you can:<br />
- perform data logic<br />
- read or execute other contracts<br />
- send or withdraw ether<br /><br />
But the execution of the smart contracts is limited by the available amount of Gas.

                <li><strong>limits</strong> the operations a smart contract can execute</li>
                <li>prevents <strong>infinite loops</strong></li>
                <li>the creator of the transactions specifies a gas fee he is willing to pay</li>

    </div>
    <aside class="notes">
        Gas is a unit that defines the limit of operations a smart contract can execute on a given transaction, so the entire network does not waste too much computational power, memory, bandwidth or storage.  <br /><br />
Infact when you want to execute a transaction on the ethereum network you have to pay a gas fee defining a maximum allowed amount of Gwei that will be involved in the transaction.  <br />
The prices of gas is set by the miners based on supply and demand for the computational power of the network needed to process smart contracts.  <br />
If running the transaction we run out of gas, the entire transaction gets rolled back.

    <h2>Ethereum standards</h2>
    <strong>Proposals (EIP)</strong> &rarr; <strong>Request for Comments (ERC)</strong>
    <br /><br />
    <ul>
        <li>ERC-20 &rarr; Fungible tokens</li>
        <li>ERC-721 &rarr; Non-fungible tokens</li>
        <li>ERC-1155 &rarr; Both fungible and non-fungible tokens</li>
        <li>ERC-223 &rarr; Improvement over ERC-20 over human errors</li>
    </ul>
    <aside class="notes">
    The Ethereum community also introduced many standards for the software programmers to work on.  
They are like interfaces which a custom smart contract must implement.  <br />
<br />
Typically, standards are introduced as Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs), which when relate to application-level layer, they become Ethereum Requests for Comments (ERCs).  <br />
<br />
Some examples of smart contracts standards are:  <br />
- ERC-20 - Used for generating fungible (interchangeable) tokens, like virtual currencies.
This standard is the most common for creating new tokens and is tipically used in Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs)<br />
- ERC-721 - Proposes a concept where token holders are able to differentiate between the tokens they hold; this goes back to the idea of non-fungible assets or tokens, commonly called NFTs.  <br />
This standard allows the tokens to represent real-world objects, real-estate properties, intellectual property rights, digital artworks and so on<br />
- ERC-1155 - Is a standard which can contain both fungible and non-fungible assets and solves some scalability issues with ERC-721<br />
- ERC-223 - Improves ERC-20, so that tokens are not lost if they are sent to the wrong wallet/contract

            <aside class="notes">
                The use of smart contracts led the way to the initial introduction of sophisticated structures based on them, like DAOs or Decentralized Autonomous Organizations, which integrate the governance and business logic rules of an actual organization with people and protocols.  <br />
                <br />
                In a DAO the code is considered the governing entity rather than people or paper contracts.  <br />
<br />
Of course, a human curator maintains this code and serves as the community's proposal evaluator.  <br />
<br />
DAOs can hire external contractors if they obtain enough feedback from token holders.  <br />
<br />
The most well-known DAO initiative is The DAO, which collected 168 million dollars through crowdfunding.  <br />
Unfortunately, as previously stated, this same project was hacked due to a weakness in the DAO code.

            <aside class="notes">
                As the notion of DAOs evolves, we may also have DACs, Decentralized Autonomous Corporations, with the primary distinction being that while DAOs are nonprofit, DACs can generate a profit through shares given to participants and to whom they can pay dividends.  <br />
<br />
The concept behind DACs is that they can manage a company autonomously without human intervention based on the logic that has been built into them.

            <aside class="notes">
                Furthermore, we can progress with the notion of DASs, or Decentralized Autonomous Societies, which are a concept in which a whole society may work on a blockchain with the assistance of several smart contracts and a combination of DAOs and DApps functioning autonomously.  <br />
<br />
This concept might involve offering many common government services, such as identity card systems, passports, marriages, and births.   <br />
<br />
While this idea might look pretty wild and cyberpunk, it is absolutely feasible on a blockchain.
